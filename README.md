# Rimpampa's quines in Rust
Some quines I made when I was inspired/bored

# List
* [first.rs](/first.rs): my first (successful) try at writing a quine
* [comment.rs](/comment.rs): the value of `t` when modified will generate a new quine with it's value added in the top and bottom comments
* [macro.rs](/macro.rs): a quine that uses macros. Is this the first one that does it?
